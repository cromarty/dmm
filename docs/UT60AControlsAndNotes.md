### Rotary Switch (from anti-clockwise to clockwise)

Function after slash is with blue function button selected.

* Voltage/ hertz(?)
* Ohms/continuity
* capacitance / (no blue function)
* hertz% / 
* Micro- amps DC / Micro-amps AC
* MilliampsDC / Milliamps AC
* Amps DC / Amps AC

* Microamps and Milliamps
* Common
* Hertz, Volts, Ohms

 




Operation Notes:

1  The blue button defaults to off at power on so this reverts the function to a known state.

2  The continuity buzzer function only works if the leads are shorted when the function
(blue) button is pressed.



Note added March 2013.  2 is wrong.  Press blue button twice for continuity buzzer
