
## These are the controls on the UT60A multimeter

### Top four buttons below display, from left to right

* range
* hertz %
* Relative
* Hold

### Two round buttons below top four buttons, left to right

* Power (In = on, out = off)
* Function button (described throughout the manual as the blue button)

### Rotary Switch (from anti-clockwise to clockwise)

Function after slash is with blue function button selected.

From the 9 o'clock position to the 3 o'clock position:

1. Voltage/ RMS
2. Ohms/ diode / continuity (cyclic function)
3. capacitance / (no blue function)
4. hertz% / 
5. Micro- amps DC / Micro-amps AC
6. MilliampsDC / Milliamps AC
7. Amps DC / Amps AC

### Four sockets at bottom, left to right

* Ten Amps
* Microamps and Milliamps
* Common
* Hertz, Volts, Ohms

 




Operation Notes:

1  The blue button defaults to off at power on so this reverts the function to a known state.

2  The continuity buzzer function only works if the leads are shorted when the function
(blue) button is pressed.



Note added March 2013.  2 is wrong.  Press blue button twice for continuity buzzer
