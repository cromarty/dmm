A measurement range determines the highest value the
Meter can measure. Most Meter functions have more
than one range. See "Accuracy Specifications."

A. Selecting a Measurement Range
Being in the right measurement range is important:
l
l

If the range is too low for the input, the Meter displays
to indicate an overload.
If the range is too high, the Meter will not display
the most accurate measurement.

B. Manual Ranging and Autoranging
The Meter has both manual range and autorange options:
l

l

In the autorange mode, the Meter selects the best
range for the input detected.
This allows you to switch test points without having
to reset the range.
In the manual range mode, you select the range.
This allows you to override autorange and lock the
Meter in a specific range.

The Meter defaults to the autorange mode in
measurement functions that have more than one range.
When the Meter is in the autorange mode,
is
displayed.

readings in low-resistance measurement, that is the
range of 400.0 , short-circuit the input terminals
beforehand, using the relative value function button
REL to automatically subtract the value measured
when the testing leads are short-circuited from the
reading.
l For high-resistance measurement (>1M ), it is
normal taking several seconds to obtain a stable
reading.
l If reading with shorted test leads is not 0.5 ,
check for loose test leads, incorrect function selection,
or enabled Data Hold function.
l The LCD displays
indicating open-circuit for the
tested resistor or the resistor value is higher than
the maximum range of the Meter.

Model UT60A: OPERATING MANUAL

The POWER button
This is a self-lock switch use to turn on or off the power
of the Meter.

The BLUE button
It uses for selecting the required measurement function
when there is more than one function at one position of
the rotary switch.

The Use of Relative Value Mode
The REL mode applies to all measurement functions
except in frequency/duty cycle measurement, it subtracts
a stored value from the present value and displays the
relative value (∆) as the result.
The definition is as follows:
l Relative value (∆) = present value - stored value
For instance, if the stored value is 20.0V and the
present value is 22.0V, the reading would be 2.0V.
If a new measurement value is equal to the stored
value then display 0.0V.
To enter or exit REL mode:
l Use rotary switch to select the measurement function
before selecting REL∆. If measurement functions
change manually after REL∆ is selected, the Meter
exits the REL mode.
l Press REL∆ to enter REL mode, autoranging turns
off except under capacitance testing mode, and the
present measurement range is locked and display
the last measurement value as "0" as the stored
value.
l Press REL∆ again or turn the rotary switch to reset
the stored value and exit REL Mode.
Pressing HOLD H in REL mode makes the Meter stop
updating. Pressing HOLD H again to resume updating.
