Protocol

The chip periodically sends 14-byte packets at 2400 baud, 8n1. The upper nibble of each byte indicates the byte number. The payload is composed of the lower nibbles, and is a 1-1 mapping of the LCD segments. The downside to this protocol structure is that transmission errors in the LSB nibbles cannot be detected. There is no checksum or CRC in the packet. The 4 user-defined bits can have different meaning on different multimeters using this IC.

Example Packet

17 27 3D 4F 5D 67 7D 87 9D A0 B0 C0 D4 E0 -> reads: DC 0.000V
