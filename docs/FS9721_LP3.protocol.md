Fortune Semiconductor FS9721_LP3 DMM chip
========================================

Serial Protocol
---------------


The chip periodically sends 14-byte packets at 2400 baud, 8n1. The upper nibble of each byte 
indicates the byte number. The payload is composed of the lower nibbles, and is a 1-1 mapping of the 
LCD segments. The downside to this protocol structure is that transmission errors in the LSB nibbles 
cannot be detected. There is no checksum or CRC in the packet. The 4 user-defined bits can have 
different meaning on different multimeters using this IC.


Example Packet

17 27 3D 4F 5D 67 7D 87 9D A0 B0 C0 D4 E0 -> reads: DC 0.000V

Packet structure:

|| Byte  | Bits 7-4  | Bit 3  | Bit 2  | Bit 1  | Bit 0   |

Each digit on the meter uses 2 bytes to store it's setting.

Because the numbers are a seven-segment display, only seven bits are needed to generate the actual 
digit.

The most-significant bit is used, by the left-most digit to indicate whether the reading is 
negative.

For all other digits the most-significant bit is the decimal point bit, indicating that there is a 
decimal point before the digit.

Segment lettering
-----------------

In this little diagram the seven segments are shown with a letter which gives a clue as to which bit 
of the lower nibble of each byte controls which segment.

Each digit uses two bytes.  The high-nibble of each stores the sequence number (see above).  The 
highest bit of the low nibble of the first byte is either the negation flag (left-most character), 
or the decimal point indicator (digits other than the left-most).

So, the low-nibble of each of two bytes are like this:

Byte 1: SABC
Byte 2: DEFG

S = sign bit for the first digit or decimal point for the others.
